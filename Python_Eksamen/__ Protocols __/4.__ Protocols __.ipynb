    "Whenever you get the value of an attribute of an object the \\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_ protocol or if you have traversed a list, you have relied on it implementing the \\_\\_iter\\_\\_ protocol. Protocols are what allows a lot of the \"nice\" python syntax, like being able to combine two lists by +'ing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "They can broadly be divided into two groups: \n",
    "One group consisting of being \"fancy\" ways to call specific functions/methods, like the \"+\" and \"-\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The other group being much like required methods for implementing certain \"interfaces\", like \"iterable\" or a \"context manager\". This functionality needs certain protocols to be implemented to work, like for something to be considered an \"iterable\", something that can itereated through one element at a time,  it needs to implement the  \\_\\_iter\\_\\_() protocol, which returns an iterator object, which prescribes how the object is to be iterated over."
